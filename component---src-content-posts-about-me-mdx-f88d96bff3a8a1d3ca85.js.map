I’m a product designer who lives in Brooklyn.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What are you working on now?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I work at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.capsule.com/\"\n      }}>{`Capsule`}</a>{`. I design the workflows and tools used to run its operations. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`You’re a designer who can…?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I make tools that help people get things done faster and easier. `}</p>\n    <p>{`As a founding or first designer, I set up foundational pieces like a design system, user research practice, and a design process. I help untangle and fix design debt.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I design for consumers and business users; for responsive web, iOS, and products that live across multiple platforms.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I’m strongest in the following areas:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Prototyping and interaction design. I make prototypes at various levels of fidelity, from “Wizard of Oz”-style demos to interactive, code-based prototypes that accept and react to user input. `}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Learning what to build and why. I can go out and talk to customers, do 1:1 interviews, run user tests, and write surveys. I can use analytics to evaluate designs and tell a story of how our product is being used. `}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Thinking in and building systems rather than standalone screens.  `}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2>{`What’s your background?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I did engineering in undergrad and business in grad school. My first job was at an agency that built digital products and practiced user-centered design. `}</p>\n    <p>{`After that I started a company where I designed a product used by retailers like Gap and Sur la Table. It was true 0-1 product design that involved doing customer discovery to validate the problem, and iterating through multiple products and business models. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Post-startup, I’ve been part of product teams as the first or lead designer, working alongside founders and executives to make product decisions. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`What’s your M.O. as a designer?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I care about asking the right questions to get to the root of a problem. If we can’t answer `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`“why this?”`}</em>{` and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`“how will we know it’s working?”`}</em>{` then I’ll help us find answers.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`I make and test prototypes because the feedback helps us learn and iterate quickly. `}</p>\n    <p>{`My best decisions are made based on evidence and logic derived from first principles. I’m a fan of using frameworks to describe problems and evaluate options.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I sweat “the other 80%” of work needed to ship. That means doing QA and finessing edge cases. It also means helping my team work as a cohesive unit rather than an assembly line. I do this by showing my process and asking for feedback early to build trust, hopping on calls to clarify ambiguity, and building systems that remove friction. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Where else have you lived?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I was born, raised, and educated in Canada. Besides New York, I’ve lived in Vancouver, San Francisco, and Toronto. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I did the “digital nomad” thing for a year and change. I spent seven months in Rio de Janeiro, and the rest of my time was split between Buenos Aires and Paris. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`What are your interests?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I go through phases where I enjoy being a big nerd. Then there are periods where you might find me at an afterparty in Berlin, São Paulo, or Bushwick. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I like reading about science and history and anything that explains people and why they do what they do. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Sapiens`}</em>{` is a perfect intersection of all these topics. Recently I read `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Until the End of Time`}</em>{` by Brain Greene. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`The Beginning of Infinity`}</em>{` by David Deutsch is another book I love. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I’m also into photography. I used to post my photos on Instagram, but I stopped because social media is a hell of a drug and I had to quit.  `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Why did you make this website?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This site is a space where I can do the following:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Publish and practice writing.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Learn to code and apply what I learn. `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Tell my story to learn about myself.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Tell my story to connect with likeminded people.`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`If you’ve read this far and you think we’d get along, feel free to drop me a line. My email is in the footer.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How did you make this website?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I coded this site using React and Styled Components. I use Gatsby to generate static HTML files from the code, and I host those files on Github Pages. The content is written in markdown, using MDX, and that data is pulled in using GraphQL. `}</p>\n    <p>{`It might be over-engineered, but that’s ok. Making this site helps me learn and practice using technologies I encounter in my role as product designer. And I enjoy making it. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I’m using two typefaces by Klim Foundry: United Sans and Untitled Serif. I love all Klim’s work, but I feel a personal connection to the perfectly minimal style of Untitled. `}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  return target;\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
