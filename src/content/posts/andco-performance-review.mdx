# Introduction

My highest-level goal is to design a best-in-class web app for freelancers to run their business. 

My intermediate goal is to implement a design and development process that is strategic, systematic, and driven by evidence rather than intuition alone. 
 
I want a way of knowing that I’m working on the right things — things that are the best use of our time and resources because they will have the greatest impact on user needs and business goals. 

I want to know, based on customer feedback and analytics, if the designs I’m creating and the features we’re building are working to meet user needs and improve key metrics. And if the designs are or aren’t working as expected, then I want to have insight into why. 

To reach my goal and get the knowledge I need, I’ll work on three key skills:

## Set up quick feedback loops 

Designing without regular feedback from users is like working in the dark. If I put something out there and hear nothing back from users, then it’s impossible to know if I solved a problem or how to iterate toward a solution. 

In my view a feedback loop has six parts: 

1. A clearly defined goal that can be quantified.
2. The existing data that tells us what we know now, i.e. the starting point. 
3. Assumptions for how to reach the goal that are informed by what we know and first principles. 
4. Solutions (designs, prototypes, features) that make our assumptions concrete and testable.
5. Channels for feedback that let us see, ask, and quantify if/how/why users are using our solutions in a way that achieves the goal.
6. A quick assessment of the feedback to update our assumptions and refine our solutions. 

## Create frameworks for decision making

It’s important to have guiding principles for making decisions strategically and deliberately. Without a framework, there’s no way to clearly articulate why one feature should be worked on over another. 

When everyone on the team sees the rationale behind a decision, we can all feel confident that we’re doing something that makes sense and is worthy of our time. And if there’s a disagreement, a framework gives us the foundation for an informed and productive debate.

## Organize work into themes

When too much time is spent on disconnected tasks that pull us in a million different directions, it can feel like running fast and getting nowhere. Work gets done, but because it doesn’t ladder up to a larger, more visible outcome, it’s hard to see or celebrate the results. 

I can make our process more systematic by defining high-level themes or areas for improvement and then showing how each task supports a larger theme. This way everyone knows how a task contributes to a longer-term objective. Doing things this way also makes it easier to see and measure our progress over time.
