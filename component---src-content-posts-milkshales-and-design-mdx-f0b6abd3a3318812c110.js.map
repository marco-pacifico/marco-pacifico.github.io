It was in grad school, when I watched Clay Christensen’s lecture on milkshakes. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The lessons in that lecture changed how I looked at the world and shaped how I’ve thought about design ever since. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In this post I’ll share the insights that have stuck with me over the years, and continue to guide how I practice design. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`1. Products exist to fulfill unmet needs`}</h2>\n    <p>{`A product is more than an object with a set of properties. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Dig deep enough and you’ll find people don’t buy things merely to possess or consume them. Instead they “hire” products to fulfill their unmet needs. `}</p>\n    <p>{`People’s needs can be functional or emotional or both. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`2. Needs have to be uncovered`}</h2>\n    <p>{`People aren’t always consciously aware of their own needs. They might explain their behavior with reasoning that sounds plausible but is incomplete or inaccurate.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can slough off the layers of plausible explanation by observing people’s behavior and asking them `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`the right questions`}</em>{`. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Keep digging and you’ll uncover true unmet needs, which tell you the root of the design problem to solve.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`3. Needs frame the design problem`}</h2>\n    <p>{`A design problem can be framed by asking how we might fulfill the unmet needs that arise for a person in a given context. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If you understand the needs to solve for, you can use that insight to design a superior product or experience. `}</p>\n    <p>{`A key part of the design process at this stage is connecting the dots between design decisions and how they might meet a specific need. `}</p>\n    <p>{`By framing the design problem in this way, each design decision can be tied back to a hypothesis about how and why it will address an unmet need. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`4. Designs decisions are hypotheses that can be tested using prototypes`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Designers make educated guesses about what might work best. Good design decisions are rooted in logic, knowledge, and evidence. `}</p>\n    <p>{`But however educated, a guess is not reality. The only way to know if a design will work is to put it in front of the people it’s meant to serve, in the context in which it’s meant to be encountered. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The most powerful part of the design process is quickly turning ideas into something tangible with which people can interact and react against. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Designers make prototypes. Prototypes can be tested quickly, on a small scale. Test results reveal if a design is working or not. And this feedback is used to improve the design.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`5. The effect of a design will be visible and measurable`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Design is not a purely theoretical exercise. A design will have an effect on the world, and its effect will be visible and measurable. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If you can’t answer the question, “How will you know it’s working?” then you can’t even begin the design process, let alone complete it.  `}</p>\n    <h2>{`6. Good design creates markets`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Marketing is not merely a synonym for branding or advertising. It’s the act of expanding and creating markets. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Markets are expanded and created when we find new and better ways to serve unmet needs. And that’s done by designing better products, services, and experiences. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`My path into design`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I was inspired by the design process I saw in that lecture about milkshakes. But the thing that blew my mind was discovering that the process translated into a profession. `}</p>\n    <p>{`It was someone’s job to ask the right questions, frame the problem, connect the dots, and design products that improved people’s lives.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`This realization set me on a path, at times meandering, that’s made the designer I am today.  `}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  return target;\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
